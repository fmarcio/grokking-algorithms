# About

My answers to the book _Grokking Algorithms_ by Aditya Y. Bhargava. The code here is in JavaScript, although the book uses Python.

This repository is organized into folders by chapters of the book. Each chapter folder contains JS files with my answers. Besides that, there are subfolders with unit tests written in Jest and a run code file.

# Running tests

To run the tests, simply execute `npm run test` in your terminal from the project’s root directory.

Test files are named like `(file name).test.js`

# Check results in VS Code output tab

The run code files provide a quick way to view code output directly in your VS Code output tab, so you don’t need to use the browser console. For easier execution, you can download the **Code Runner** extension by Jun Han, right click in the file and choose `Run code`.

Run code files are named like `(file name)-run.js`

# How to download project and install dependencies

In your terminal, run:

- `git clone git@github.com:fmarcio/grokking-algorithms.git`

- cd `(project folder name)`

- run `npm install`
